    "The following script integrates the results generated by RNAContigProfiler with a table derived from DEGs analysis, containing only those genes identified as DE. In this study, an exclusive lncRNA for a given sample is defined as an lncRNA whose overexpression is consistent across all tissues. Therefore, we seek neighbouring mRNAs detected by RNAContigProfiler that exhibit the same expression patterns. The files needed to run the notebooks can be found in the notebooks_files folder.\n",
